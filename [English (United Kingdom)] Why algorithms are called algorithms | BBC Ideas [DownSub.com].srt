1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,760
We think of an algorithm
as something new,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,040
but the term actually dates
back about 900 years.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
The word algorithm
comes from the name

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,440
of a Persian mathematical genius,
Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,400
He was born around 780 AD in the
region now known as Uzbekistan.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,160
His name suggests he came
from Khwarizm.

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,200
Known as al-Khwarizmi, he was
director in the House of Wisdom,

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,080
an intellectual centre for scholars
in 9th Century Baghdad.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,480
He made innovative contributions
to mathematics, astronomy,

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,480
geography and cartography,

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,440
and wrote an influential book called

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,040
Concerning the Hindu
Art of Reckoning.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,040
300 years later,
the book was rediscovered

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,000
and translated into Latin.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,160
It introduced Hindu-Arabic
numerals to the West,

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,400
which eventually replaced
the unwieldy Roman ones.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,200
The Hindu-Arabic number system,
along with the decimal point,

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,800
both described by al-Khwarizmi in his
book, are the basis of the numbers

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,000
we use throughout the world today.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Al-Khwarizmi's name, when
Latinised in the title of the book,

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,600
became algoritmi.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,800
And this is the origin
of the word algorithm.

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,240
We also have al-Khwarizmi
to thank for the word algebra,

24
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
which comes from another
of his works.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,560
His books revolutionised
mathematics in the West,

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,680
showing how complex problems

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,320
could be broken down
into simpler parts and solved.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,760
In medieval Latin, algorismus simply
meant the decimal number system.

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,040
By the 13th Century, it had become
an English word and was used,

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,160
for example, by Chaucer.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,560
But it wasn't until
the late 19th Century

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,560
that algorithm came to mean
a set of step-by-step rules

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,880
for solving a problem.

34
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,360
In the early part of the
20th Century, Alan Turing,

35
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,640
the British mathematician and
computer scientist, worked out how,

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,880
in theory, a machine could
follow algorithmic instructions

37
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,320
and solve complex mathematics.

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,720
This was the birth
of the computer age.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,760
During World War Two, he built
a machine called the Bombe,

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,000
which used algorithms
to crack the Enigma code.

41
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,760
Today algorithm is a fairly
common term,

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,200
even if sometimes you're not
exactly sure what an algorithm does.

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,120
Algorithms are everywhere now,
helping us to get from A to B,

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,400
driving internet searches,
making recommendations of things

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,080
for us to buy, watch or share.

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,840
And predicting how we vote
or who we fall in love with.

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,960
This little word that
originated in medieval Persia

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,160
is gradually transforming our lives.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,620
Thanks for watching! :)
